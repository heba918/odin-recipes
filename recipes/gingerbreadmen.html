        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> These are the best gingerbread men I've ever eaten. They have a nice light flavor with a hint of orange.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="test">
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 and half cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 and half tablespoon orange zest</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dark corn syrup</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>half teaspoon ground cloves
            <li>half teaspoon salt</li>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cream the butter and the sugar together. Add the egg and mix well. Mix in the orange peel and dark corn syrup. Add the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, ground cloves and salt, mixing until well combined. Chill dough for at least 2 hours, I like to chill overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough out to 1/4 inch thick. Cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters. Place cookies 1 inch apart on the prepared cookie sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are firm and lightly toasted on the edges.</li>
        </ol>
